# Hi, I’m Saajan 👋

I work as a **Cloud Administrator**, supporting and improving **AWS infrastructure and data pipelines** used in production.

My day-to-day work involves keeping systems reliable, monitoring what’s running, fixing issues when they occur, and gradually improving how things are built and operated.

---

## What I do day-to-day

- Administer and support **production AWS environments**
- Monitor infrastructure and applications using **CloudWatch**
- Handle incidents, troubleshoot issues, and perform **root cause analysis**
- Build and support **data pipelines** (real-time and batch)
- Work closely with application, data, and platform teams

---

## AWS services I work with

- Compute & Networking: EC2, VPC, IAM, Load Balancers
- Data & Analytics: S3, Glue, EMR, Kinesis, Athena
- Automation & Ops: Lambda, CloudWatch

---

## Tools & skills

- Python (automation, ETL, utilities)
- Bash / Shell scripting
- SQL (analysis and validation)
- Monitoring, alerting, and operational support
- High availability and cost-aware design

---

## Projects you’ll see here

- Log analytics and monitoring pipelines on AWS
- Streaming ingestion using Kinesis
- ETL jobs built with AWS Glue
- Batch processing workloads using EMR

Projects here focus on **how systems behave in production**, not just how to set them up.

## How I approach cloud operations

- Stability first, improvements next  
- Automate what repeats  
- Monitor before users complain  
- Design with cost and failure in mind
