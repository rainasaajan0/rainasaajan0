# Hi, I’m Saajan 👋

I’m a **Cloud Engineer** working with **AWS**, focused on building and supporting **reliable data pipelines and cloud infrastructure**.

I enjoy working close to production systems — designing pipelines, handling failures, improving monitoring, and making sure things work reliably over time.

---

## What I work on

- Building **real-time and batch data pipelines** on AWS  
- Supporting **production cloud infrastructure**
- Working with **AWS Glue, EMR, Kinesis, Lambda, S3, and Athena**
- Monitoring systems, handling incidents, and doing root cause analysis
- Improving performance and controlling cloud costs

---

## Tech I use regularly

**Cloud & Data**
- AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch)
- Glue, EMR, Kinesis, Lambda, Athena

**Code & Automation**
- Python
- Bash / Shell scripting
- SQL

---

## Projects you’ll find here

- AWS log analytics and data lake pipelines  
- Streaming ingestion (Kinesis → S3)  
- ETL jobs using AWS Glue  
- Distributed batch processing with EMR  

Each project focuses on **how things work in practice**, including trade-offs and operational considerations.

## How I think about cloud systems

- Reliability comes first  
- Monitoring is as important as code  
- Automation reduces human error  
- Cost matters once systems scale
